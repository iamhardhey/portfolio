            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                My name is <strong>Olaoye Sulaimon Adekunle</strong>.
                I’m a web developer focused on building clean, modern, and functional
                websites that communicate clearly and perform effectively.
            </p>

            <p>
                I work primarily with <strong>international clients</strong>, especially
                <strong>DTC (Direct-to-Consumer) brands</strong>, helping them translate
                their ideas into strong digital experiences that feel intentional
                and professionally executed.

<!-- VALUES -->
<section class="extra-section light">
    <h3>How I Think & Work</h3>
    <p>
        I believe good design is quiet but confident.
        I value clarity, structure, and attention to detail.
        Every project I take on is approached with purpose,
        not shortcuts.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m selective about the work I do because I care deeply
        about quality. If we work together, you can expect
        clear communication, honesty, and consistency from start to finish.
    </p>

<!-- INTERESTS -->
<section class="extra-section">
    <h3>Beyond Code</h3>
    <p>
        Outside of development, I’m deeply interested in fashion
        and personal presentation. I’m also a fragrance enthusiast —
        details matter to me, whether it’s a clean interface or
        how something makes people feel.
    </p>

    <p>
        This mindset naturally reflects in my work:
        balanced layouts, thoughtful spacing, and experiences
        that feel refined rather than rushed.
    </p>

<!-- CLOSING -->
<section class="extra-section">
    <p>
        I’m always looking to grow, refine my craft,
        and collaborate with people who value quality.
        If you’re building something meaningful and want
        a developer who cares about the details,
        we’ll work well together.
